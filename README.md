# Library-Simulation
When I took my AP Computer Science Principles class in my junior year of high school (2015-2016), we were given the task
to create a library simulator implementing the queue data structure. Sadly, this task was never fully completed as we
had to move on with our curriculum. 
Now that I currently have two years of experience in computer science, I have decided to challenge myself by finishing
the library simulator with added features.
